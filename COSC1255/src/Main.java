		 * 
		 * - todays date, this just means we have the users information and he wants to start the questionnaire then figure out his workout 
		 * 
		 * - general information, this is where the user can access all sorts of info like current stamina level for example, u can be creative with this as well
		 * 
		 * - now everytime a user finishes doing the questionnaire and picking his workout a new text file should be created that acts a diary of ssorts, this file shows the date, the answers to his questionnaire and the workout he did
		 * - these files regardless of the date should also be accessible from the menu 
		 * when i say he i mean he/she, not to sound sexist
