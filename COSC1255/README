Dear Reader, 

This project is for our Data Structures class (COSC125). 
We have decided to build a fitness Manager/ Assistant for mainly athletes. 
The way the program works is the user has a stamina level that is 100% by default. 
The user has to answer a questionnaire that asks about sleep levels, food In-take and soreness levels every morning. Then the user is presented with the option to work out if they choose to.
The Workout can be created by the program based on how much stamina the user plans on using up or the user may themself create their own Workout from a pre-determined list of exercises. 
The stamina level is recalculated daily based on sleep, food, soreness and fatigue. 
We hope you enjoy it.
